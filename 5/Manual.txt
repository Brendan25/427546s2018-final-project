This project runs entirely in WebGL. All that's needed to start the project up is to open the html file
in a web browser that supports WebGL.

How to Use:
- Use the sliders provided to modify certain aspects of the model along the X, Y, and Z axes:
1) Its position within the frame.
2) Its angle of rotation.
	Note: Overuse of these controls currently leads to a glitch where the 3D model begins to shrink
	exponentially. Refresh the page if this happens.
3) Its overall scale.
4) The amount of shearing
	Note: The shearing controls are currently glitchy and cause the 3D model to exponentially grow
	out of view. Refresh the page if this happens.
5) The positions in the frame of two different light sources.

- Use the buttons to swap between different camera angles of the model. The above controls work
regardless of the camera being used.
