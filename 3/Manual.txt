This project runs entirely in WebGL. All that's needed to start the project up is to open the html file
in a web browser that supports WebGL.

How to Use:
- In the UI, you'll see three different canvases, each representing one 3D object view.
- Next to each canvas, you'll also see several buttons and a color list. These are used
for selecting the shapes you'd like to draw on the canvas and what color the resulting shape will be.
- To draw, simply click on the canvas at each point where you'd like to place a vertex. By default,
  the program is set to draw a black line. Once the required number of points have been given, the
  program will draw the requested shape at the points given.

  Minimum number of points per shape:
	Line: 2 per line
	Polyline: 2 for the first line, then 1 more point for each subsequent line
	Triangle: 3 per triangle
	Custom Polygon: 3 for the first triangle, then 1 more point for each subsequent shape.

- To stop drawing one shape and start a new one on the same canvas without erasing the previous,
click one of the new shape buttons on the right side of the canvas. This will save your previous shape
and let you draw new shapes alongside it.
- Once all shapes are drawn, click "Convert to 3D" to generate the 3D model. This will remove the front,
side and top canvases from view and replace them with the Result canvas, which contains the object.
- To alter the position, rotation and scale of the 3D model, use the sliders to the right of the Results
canvas.
- To create a new 3D model or reset the 2D canvases, press the "New 3D Object" button. This resets
each canvas back to a default state.
