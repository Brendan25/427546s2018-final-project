This project runs entirely in WebGL. All that's needed to start the project up is to open the html file
in a web browser that supports WebGL.

How to Use:
- Use the sliders provided to modify certain aspects of the model along the X, Y, and Z axes:
1) Its position within the frame.
2) Its angle of rotation.
3) Its overall scale.
4) The amount of shearing

5) The positions in the frame of two different light sources.

- Use the buttons to swap between different camera angles of the model. The above controls work
regardless of the camera being used.
- Press "Enable Parallel View" to swap to the Parallel Projection view. Use the controls below to modify the x, y and z axis vanishing
points. Press "Enable Parallel View" again to reset the camera.
- Press "Enable Oblique View" to swap to the Oblique Projection view. Use the controls below the button to modify the object's shearing
to simulate different oblique views. Note that normal shearing controls are disabled when in Oblique View. Swap to a different view to
re-enable normal shearing controls.
